## Quick Start

### Add Procyon Web Assistant to Chrome Extensions 

### Access to Local Ollama

To access the locally deployed Ollama, you need to manually adjust its security settings.
(As part of this project, we aim to provide a solution with full transparency, ensuring users can use the Procyon Web Assistant without concerns about privacy leaks or security risks.)

1. To modify Ollama's security level, run the following command in the terminal:

    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"

2. Restart Ollama.
3. **Note** : You will need to set the OLLAMA_ORIGINS environment variable each time the hosting computer is restarted.
